# What is it about

I needed to create a perfect maze. <br>
This is my attempt to create one. <br>

It randomly generates a path. <br>
When its blocked/surrounded by white tiles <br>
it starts a new path at the next available spot. <br>

It still has some issues like: <br>
-Continues on other side when hitting the wall <br>
-Sometimes creates unreachable spots <br>
