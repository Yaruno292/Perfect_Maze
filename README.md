# What is it about

I needed to create a perfect maze.
This is my attempt to create one.

It randomly generates a path.
When its blocked/surrounded by
white tiles, it starts a new path
at the next available spot.

It still has some issues like:
-Continues on other side when hitting the wall
-Sometimes creates unreachable spots
